In your local computer, first install git.
Create a folder with any name. for example: GIT_basics
git bash to that folder.

write command: git init
it is for initializing the project. you will see a file named .git
write command: git status
this is for checking the status of this project.

now create a file in the GIT_basics folder. you can create with command or just create it in usual way.
THen write some thing on that file.
check the status again by writing 'git status'

Then add the file for staging. it needs to be done before committing
git add filename.txt

To add all the files: git add .

To remove the added files: git reset

now commit the change. commit must be done before pushing it to the github repository. By committing, untracted files gets tracted.

command: git commit -m "first commit"

To upload your project to gitHub repository, write the following command

git remote add origin repository path

for example: git remote add origin https://github.com/tanvee38/hello-world.git

now push your project to gitHub repository.

command: git push origin master

now your project has been uploaded to github repo. Now you can change the file. add more things in the github repo. 
Now if you want to pull all the updated things to your local folder GIT_basics you have to use pull command.

By pulling, project come from github repo to your local folder where your project first got initialized.

command: git pull origin master

Everything of that project will be pulled.

Now suppose, you are in a different pc and you want to get your project from github repo. Here, you have to clone it.
for cloning:

write command: git clone github repo path

for example: git clone https://github.com/tanvee38/hello-world.git
